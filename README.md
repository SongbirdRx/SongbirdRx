# Hi there, I'm Songbird 👋

I am a **Software Engineer** and **Security Researcher** with a background in **Software Engineering** and **Applied Psychology**. 
I enjoy exploring the intersection of system internals and security.

### 🛠️ What I do
* **Reverse Engineering:** I spend a lot of time with `IDA Pro`, `Frida`, and `Unicorn` analyzing complex systems.
* **Android Security:** I work on `AOSP` customization, kernel-level research, and bypassing various security protections.
* **Cryptography:** I have experience implementing and analyzing both standard and modified cryptographic algorithms (SM2/3/4, RSA, AES).
* **De-obfuscation:** specifically focusing on OLLVM and VMP analysis.

### 💻 Tech Stack
* **Languages:** Java, Python, C/C++, and Armv8-A Assembly.
* **Interests:** Binary protocol reconstruction, system-level stealth, and automation tool development.
